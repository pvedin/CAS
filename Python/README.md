There are two ways to run these programs:
1. Run the .exe programs. This does not require you to download Python. However, you will not be able to see the source code.
2. Open the .py(w) files. To open the .py(w) files, download Python (version 3+): https://www.python.org/downloads/

   Then, download the .py files and open them; either directly, which will open them in the command line
   (unless the file is a .pyw, in which case a tkinter window will open instead),
   or via IDLE, by right-clicking the file and selecting "Edit with IDLE" and pressing F5 once it has been opened.
